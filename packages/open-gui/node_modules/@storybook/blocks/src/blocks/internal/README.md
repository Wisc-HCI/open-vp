# Internal `@storybook/blocks` Stories

This directory contains stories that are not suitable for public documentation, but that we still want to keep to ensure things don't break.

Some blocks have deprecated features that users shouldn't use moving forward, and these internal stories represents those.
That way we can still test them and ensure the features work, until they are removed for good.

This directory is not part of the (public) Blocks Storybook, but are included in the full UI Storybook.
