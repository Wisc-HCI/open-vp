# OpenVP
A Customizable Visual Programming Environment for Robotics Applications

## Running the Examples
The examples can be run by navigating to the root folder where this is installed

`cd open-vp`

Then run

`npm install`

Then navigate to the docs folder:

`cd apps/docs`

And run

`npm run dev`

This will launch a Storybook window, with examples for each of some basic elements, and also examples for the `<Environment/>` Element. You can see the source code for these examples in the stories themselves.

More documentation, especially for the various specification types and integration with outside applications is coming soon!
