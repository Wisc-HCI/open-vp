# Installation

`OpenVP` can be installed via the node package manager (NPM) into an existing react project:

```bash npm2yarn
npm i @people_and_robots/open-vp
```

You may also want to include other libraries, especially if you want to use typescript or dive in deeper into the internals:

```bash npm2yarn
npm i @people_and_robots/open-core
```

Or if you want access to many of the same UI building blocks that are used within `OpenVP`:

```bash npm2yarn
npm i @people_and_robots/open-gui
```
