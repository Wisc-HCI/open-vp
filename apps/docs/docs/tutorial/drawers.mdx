# Drawers

To start dragging in blocks into the canvas, we will need a place to drag them from. That is where the drawer comes in. The drawer is located on the left-hand side of the environment, and organizes blocks based on a specification you provide. Let's use the previous blocks we created, and create some drawers for them.

## DrawerSpec

The drawer is customized with a set of [DrawerSpec](/docs/api/drawer-spec) entries. The `DrawerSpec` comes in two variants, the `ObjectDrawerSpec` and the `ReferenceDrawerSpec`. The `ObjectDrawerSpec` is used to specify a drawer that contains multiple different types of block instances, while the `ReferenceDrawerSpec` is used to provide draggable references to existing instances (or calls to existing functions) defined in the program.

For our purposes here, we will only be using the `ObjectDrawerSpec`. First, let's create a single drawer that includes both blocks we created in the previous section.

```js
const drawers = [
  {
    title: "Blocks",
    type: DrawerType.Multiple,
    metaType: MetaType.ObjectInstance,
    objectTypes: ["simpleType", "textType"],
    icon: "SquareRounded",
  },
];
```

And here is the result of that configuration, rendered in the environment:

<div style={{ height: 400, width: "100%" }}>
<BrowserOnly>
<Environment
initial={{
    programSpec: {
      drawers: [
        {
          title: "Blocks",
          type: "MULTIPLE",
          metaType: "OBJECT-INSTANCE",
          objectTypes: ["simpleType", "textType"],
          icon: "SquareRounded",
        },
      ],
      objectTypes: {
        simpleType: {
          name: "Simple Block",
          primitiveType: "OBJECT",
          description: "# Markdown-Flavored Description String",
          instanceBlock: {
            onCanvas: true,
            color: "#3f3f3f",
            icon: "SquareRounded",
            extras: [],
          },
          referenceBlock: {
            onCanvas: true,
            color: "#3f3f3f",
            icon: "SquareRounded",
            extras: [],
          },
          properties: {
            myProperty: {
              id: "myProperty",
              type: "BLOCK",
              name: "My Property",
              accepts: ["textType"],
              default: null,
              isList: false,
              fullWidth: false,
            },
            myNumericalProperty: {
              id: "myNumericalProperty",
              type: "NUMBER",
              name: "My Number",
              default: 10,
              min: 0,
              max: 100,
              step: 1,
              units: "m/s",
            },
          },
        },
        textType: {
          name: "Text Block",
          primitiveType: "OBJECT",
          description: "# Markdown-Flavored Description String",
          instanceBlock: {
            onCanvas: false,

            extras: [],
            minified: true,
          },
          referenceBlock: {
            onCanvas: false,
            color: "#629e6c",
            icon: "SquareRounded",
            extras: [],
            minified: true,
          },
          properties: {
            text: {
              id: "text",
              type: "STRING",
              name: "Text",
              default: "Hello World!",
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
