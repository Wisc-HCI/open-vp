# Empty Project

The first step to using OpenVP is to import the `Environment` component and include it within your app, wherever it needs to go. By default, the `Environment` component will expand to fill the size of the parent element.

```jsx live
// import { Environment } from "@people_and_robots/open-vp"

function App(props) {
  return (
    <div style={{ height: 400, width: "100%" }}>
      <Environment />
    </div>
  );
}
```

This will create a blank canvas that you can use to start building your own visual programming environment. The `Environment` component is the main entry point for the OpenVP library.
