# API Intro

The API for OpenVPis built on Typescript, and as a specification, relies heavily on a nested configuration. The starting point is the [ProgramSpec](/docs/api/program-spec)), which is a configuration for the entire program. It also uses a set of [enum values](/docs/category/enums/) mapping to strings (acccessible through the `@people_and_robots/core` package) that provide a nice interface for specifying certain types of data structures.
